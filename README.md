# SDL3 Starter

## Overview

A simple repo designed to help you get started on SDL3. It uses Visual Studio 2022, Windows 11, x64-based processor, and SDL 3.2.24. The file paths are according to my computer, so I recommend changing them to your
own. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Naksh-Rathore/sdl3-starter.git`
2. Change the file paths in the project configs to your own
3. Code something and run it!

## Contributing

If something is not working, can be improved, or something else to help the rep, feel free to drop an issue or PR. This project is licensed under the MIT License. More info in
